# Neuroplasticity
This repository contains material related to the article "Mechanistic Explanation of Neuroplasticity Using Equivalent Circuits" in bioRxiv, (DOI 10.1101/2023.05.21.541639). More specifically, it holds SPICE netlists and symbol files for the neuron model and the experiments. The files have been tested with [LTspice XVII. Version 17.0.34.0](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) but will probably work with other SPICE simulators as well.
